# Helpo

It’s Helpo; the lightest live transcription app for Android! It’s also loaded with amazing features; yet coming in the smallest size possible! 

Still not convinced? Well, there are plenty reasons to get on board:

• As you already know, Helpo is powered the lightest yet fastest live transcription engine. Say it, and it’ll transcribe your speech even before thinking the next sentence! Plus, when you finish, it’ll read out loud what you just dictated.

• Featuring an industry-leading, but easy-to-use interface, operating Helpo is as simple as tapping a button. Literally! It’s also customisable, meaning that your homescreen wallpaper blends seamlessly in the background, along with light grey and blue hues and curved corners.

• Implementing our in-house ProScript technology, correcting the slightest mistake is much easier than ever before. Of course, you can always use your keyboard to manually edit your text, even before finishing dictation!

• Offering built-in support for English and Greek, means you can dictate in both languages into the same sentence! Want more languages? Good news then; being completely open-source means adding your’s is a few code lines away!

• Size; a true taboo regarding apps. Thankfully, Helpo comes at just 1.5mb, or let’s say it’s as light as a photo.

• Found any in-app advertisements? Don’t search much because you won’t; you know, we hate compromises like those.

As always, we’ll be more than happy if you contact us at helpo.assistant@gmail.com. You can say Hi, propose new features, seek technical support or point out bugs (yet we’re pretty confident you won’t find any of these).

Microphone Permission Disclaimer:
Helpo needs microphone access to transcribe your speech. The audio is not stored after the transcription is processed, which happens natively on your device. Also, every time you dictate Helpo, five animated voice bars will replace the main button, so you know when your microphone is being actively accessed. We firmly believe in the importance of privacy, and Helpo is the proof.

Note: Voice functionality might not work on some older Samsung devices. We are aware of the issue and do our best to eliminate it on an upcoming update.
